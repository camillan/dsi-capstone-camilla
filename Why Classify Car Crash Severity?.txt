The problem/question:
- Classify car crashes as involving injury or not
- In a theoretical use case, an 911 dispatcher could use this model to inform their decision to send or not send emergency medical care.



Business understanding. On first guess, what would the features likely be?
** Given that you already know there's been a crash **
Physical Impact Conditions:
- Direction of the other vehicles
- Where the impact was on body of car
- Speed
- Number of vehicles involved
- Size of vehicles relative to one another

The Environment Conditions:
- Deadly cliffs, mountains (bridges?)
- Time of day
- Type of road
- Atmospheric cover on the road

Conditions About the Occupants:
- Weight and age of people involved
- Use of seatbelts
- Pedestrians involved? yes or no
- Trucks involved? yes or no
- Was there an illegal maneuver involved?

Cars:
- Vehicle safety rating



Next steps:
- Find or engineer those features in the dataset, bringing in more data.
- Improve model accuracy.
- Have outline for presentation on Friday.
